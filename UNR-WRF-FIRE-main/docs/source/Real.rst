---------------------

.. raw_html

  Diet is important for overall heath and essential for muscle tone and gains. The word "diet" has a poor connotation when it gets thrown around, when actually it    is on a spectrum. There are strict diets that can expedite gains and muscle tone, altough there are also lenient diets that keep you healthy but allow you to enjoy yourelf with food once in a while, while still staying healthy. <br>

Without a diet goal, you are not getting the most out of your workout potential and can slow your progress in the gym.
