Why Do You Need to Stretch?
---------------------------

For a lot of people, stretching is the most overlooked aspect in their journey of fitness. It’s understandable, stretching can easily be viewed as boring or useless because they don’t directly convert to gains.

The truth is, stretching before and after a workout is the most important thing you can do for your body. Stretching means all of the differences in preventing injury, pain, or strain.

Let’s say you were getting ready to workout, but you arrive at the gym after a long day of sitting at school. If you just jump into your exercise you automatically have put yourself at a high risk of injury because you are stressing out muscles that have become tight due to your inactivity.

When is the Best Time to Stretch?
It is always a good idea to stretch before AND after your workout. It is a good idea to incorporate dynamic stretching before your workout and static stretching after your workout. Below are some stretches that you can start to incorporate into your routine.

Dynamic Stretches: Pre-Workout
------------------------------

Dynamic stretches are active movements that utilize a full range of motion to warm up the muscles. Dynamic stretching helps increase muscle temperature and reduce stiffness. We’ve named 5 dynamic stretches below, of course, there are many more, but these are a few great ones to become familiar with.

    Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, engage your core and squat down making sure to not let your knees pass your toes. Hold for 10 seconds, and then slowly come back up. <br>
High Knees
Stand feet shoulder-width apart, bring your knee to your chest while rapidly switching back and forth between each leg. Almost as if you were running in place.
Leg Swings
Standing straight forward, swing your leg back and forth smoothly. Do 10 times each leg.
Lunges
Start standing feet shoulder-width apart, take a big step forward and lower your body with all of your weight shifted to your heels, and then lower your body until your thigh is parallel to the floor.
Arm Circles
Standing feet shoulder-width apart, extend your arms out to your side parallel to the floor and slowly start moving your arms in a circular motion, gradually increasing the size of the circles. Repeat the motion in reverse as well.

Static Stretches: Post-Workout
------------------------------

Static stretching involves holding your stretch for a certain period of time, usually between 10-60 seconds. These stretches are performed in a still position without any movement (dynamically).

Post-workout static stretches help relax the muscles and increase flexibility which will ultimately reduce the risk of injury.

Depending on what muscle group you worked out, those are the stretches that you should focus on in your post-workout routine.

Examples of static stretches:
-----------------------------

*Shoulder Stretch*
Stand feet shoulder-width apart bring your arm across your chest. Bend your other arm and wrap around the front of your crossed arm. Using the bent arm, begin to slowly pull on your crossed arm while still facing forward. You should feel a stretch in the shoulder. Do this for both shoulders.
*Toe Touch*
Stand facing forward with your feet slightly apart and toes facing forward. Bend from the hips and reach down towards your toes
*Cobra Stretch*
Begin lying face down on the floor. Bring your hands close to your chest, tighten your glutes, and slowly begin to curl your chest up away from the floor
*Knee To Chest*
Starting in a standing position, pull one knee up towards your chest and hold. Repeat this stretch 2-4 times on each leg
*Quadricep Stretch*
Starting in a standing position, bend your leg backward and grab the top of your foot with your hand, hold this position and repeat on each leg 2-4 times.
